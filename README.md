| [`0x01. Lockboxes`](https://github.com/sabrallah/alx-interview/tree/master/0x01-lockboxes) | It aims to learn about locked boxes in **Python language**.|
| [`0x02. Minimum Operations`](https://github.com/sabrallah/alx-interview/tree/master/0x02-minimum_operations) | It aims to learn about minimum operations in **Python language**.|
| [`0x03. log_parsing`](https://github.com/sabrallah/alx-interview/tree/master/0x03-log_parsing) | It aims to learn about  reads input from standard input (stdin) line by line and computes certain metrics based on the input format provided  in **Python language**.|
| [`0x04. UTF-8 Validation`](https://github.com/sabrallah/alx-interview/tree/master/0x04-utf8_validation) | It aims to learn about the UTF-8 Validation **Python language**.|
| [`0x05. nqueens`](https://github.com/sabrallah/alx-interview/tree/master/0x05-nqueens) | It aims to implement a solution for the N Queens puzzle using Python. **Python language**.|
| [`0x06. starwars_api`](https://github.com/sabrallah/alx-interview/tree/master/0x06-starwars_api) | It aims to create a script that interacts with the Star Wars API to retrieve and display information about characters from a specific Star Wars movie. **Javascript language**.|
| [`0x07-rotate_2d_matrix`](https://github.com/sabrallah/alx-interview/tree/master/0x07-rotate_2d_matrix) | The key focus is on understanding matrix manipulation, in-place operations, and utilizing nested loops for efficient iteration through matrices. **Python language**.|
| [`0x08-making_change`](https://github.com/sabrallah/alx-interview/tree/master/0x08-making_change) | The purpose of the project is to create a function makeChange(coins, total) that calculates the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given total amount. **Python language**.|
| [`0x09-island_perimeter`](https://github.com/sabrallah/alx-interview/blob/master/0x09-island_perimeter/0-island_perimeter.py) | The purpose of the provided code is to implement a Python function, island_perimeter(grid), that calculates the perimeter of an island based on a 2D grid representation. The grid consists of 0s and 1s, where 0 represents water and 1 represents land. The goal is to determine the perimeter of the island by counting the edges that connect the land cells to the wate. **Python language**.|
| [`(0x0A-primegame)`](https://github.com/sabrallah/alx-interview/tree/master/0x0A-primegame) | The project "0x0A. Prime Game" aims to challenge participants in solving a competitive game scenario involving two players, Maria and Ben. The objective is to determine the winner of each game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers **Python language**.|
