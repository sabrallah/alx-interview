# 0x0A. Prime Game

## Overview

This project involves solving a competitive game scenario where Maria and Ben take turns choosing prime numbers from a set of consecutive integers. The goal is to determine the winner of each game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples. The project emphasizes the use of prime numbers, the Sieve of Eratosthenes, game theory, dynamic programming, and Python programming skills.

## Concepts Needed

- **Prime Numbers:**
  - Understanding what prime numbers are.
  - Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.

- **Sieve of Eratosthenes:**
  - An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, useful for this task.

- **Game Theory:**
  - Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns.
  - Understanding optimal play, win conditions, and strategies.

- **Dynamic Programming/Memoization:**
  - Using previous results to make future calculations faster.
  - Potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.

- **Python Programming:**
  - Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
  - Arrays and lists for storing integers and tracking removed numbers.

## Tasks

### 0. Prime Game

- **Description:** Maria and Ben play a game where they choose prime numbers and remove their multiples. Determine the winner of each game.

- **Prototype:** `def isWinner(x, nums)`

- **Parameters:**
  - `x (int):` Number of rounds
  - `nums (list):` Array of n for each round

- **Return:**
  - Name of the player that won the most rounds
  - If the winner cannot be determined, return `None`

- **Assumptions:**
  - `n` and `x` will not be larger than 10000
  - Cannot import any packages in this tasks

- **Example:**
  ```python
  x = 3
  nums = [4, 5, 1]
  # Result: Ben has the most wins
